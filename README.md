# Khojum: Never Miss Another Event

Hey there! ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to Khojum.

## What's Khojum, anyway?

Khojum is your new go-to app for discovering cool events happening around you in Nepal. We're starting with Kathmandu because, let's face it, there's always something awesome happening in the city that you probably don't know about.

## The Problem We're Solving

Ever had that moment when you find out about an amazing concert... the day after it happened? Or your friends talk about this incredible festival they went to, and you're like "Wait, when was this?!"

Yeah, we hate that too. That's why we built Khojum.

## How It Works

1. **Open Khojum** on your phone or computer
2. **See what's happening** today, tomorrow, or this weekend
3. **Find events you'll love** - concerts, art shows, food festivals, you name it
4. **Never miss out again** on the experiences that make life awesome

## Join Our Community

We're building a community of people who love discovering new experiences:

## Why We Made This

Because life's too short to spend weekends wondering what to do. Nepal has so many incredible events happening all the time - we're just making them easier to find.

We're a group of Nepalis who love experiencing new things and want to make it easier for everyone else too.
